- How to print the values from the "Build Complete" column on the kanban board in order to run bulk_check ====> 

```javascript
cards = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.listWrapper')[1].querySelectorAll('.taskBoardCard')).map(card => {
    try {
        const title = card.querySelector('.titleRow')?.innerText || '';
        const note = card.querySelector('.notesPreview')?.innerText?.split('\n')[0] || '';
        console.log(`'${card.id}\t${title}\t${note}`);
    } catch (err) {
        console.error('Error processing card:', err);
    }
    return card;
});
```

```javascript
// REMOVING A BUILDER FROM A CARD ONE AT A TIME

// GOTTA SET i = 0!!!!

i++;
elements = document.querySelectorAll('.ms-Facepile-members');
lastElement = elements[elements.length - i];
lastElement.click();
document.querySelector('.personaActionButton').click();

```

- COM 753 - designer/builder omitting entire link text (just once, though...)
- other enhancement: for linker notes, show a table with columns for "old site" and "new site", also organize better (e.g. move 'check page h1 for accuracy...' out of 1-to-1 mapping table)
- CLI enhancement: use JS (or Python with bs4 I guess since I may need to download the webpage anyway) to quickly print out what changes I need to manually make / check
- question: what are the criteria of "program pages"?  Of "research pages"? (related to Linker task related to "taxonomy" field)
- CLI enhancement: external links = tooltip text generated (e.g. “XYZ website. You are being directed to a website outside of MUSC. MUSC is not responsible for any content or other aspects of the external website.")
- CLI enhancement: update the "links" command to allow finding correct Existing URL values which have a '#foo' at the end
- CLI enhancement: (see below)
	On the DSM – via the line item – check to see if the page has a column labeled “Research Taxonomy” or “Taxonomy” immediately to the right of “NOTES” column in the spread sheet.  

	If a page has taxonomy terms in that column – bring over the exact terms via the “Research Taxonomy” field in Content Editor for that page.  

- CLI enhancement: (see below)

	Links to a physician, healthcare provider, or faculty profile should use link text of the provider/faculty name and credentials:  

	Link Text Template: “Jane Smith, M.D.”  

	Tooltip Template: “Profile of Dr. Smith.”
